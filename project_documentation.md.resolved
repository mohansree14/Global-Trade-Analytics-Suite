# Global Trade Analytics Suite - Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
The **Global Trade Analytics Suite** is a comprehensive data analysis simulation designed to demonstrate advanced capabilities in statistical modeling, geospatial intelligence, and AI-driven forecasting. It simulates a global trade environment to analyze patterns and predict future market trends.

**Key Features:**
- **Synthetic Data Engine**: Generates realistic trade transactions with tunable trends and seasonality.
- **Geospatial Intelligence**: Visualizes trade flows on an interactive global map.
- **AI Forecasting**: Uses Machine Learning (Random Forest) to predict trade volumes with high accuracy (~95%).
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A professional-grade UI built with Streamlit for real-time data exploration.

## 2. System Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture separating data processing, analysis, and visualization.

## 3. Component Details

### A. Data Generation ([src/generate_data.py](file:///c:/Users/mohan/Desktop/trade%20abalyis/src/generate_data.py))
This module simulates a realistic economic environment.
- **Logic**: It creates 5,000+ transaction records spanning multiple years.
- **Features Simulated**: 
    - `Origin` & `Destination`: Selected from major economies (USA, China, Germany, etc.).
    - `Product Category`: Electronics, Automotive, Agri, etc.
    - **Trend Injection**: A linear growth factor is added to simulate economic expansion.
    - **Seasonality**: A multiplier is applied to Q4 dates to simulate holiday variances.
    - **Noise**: Random Gaussian noise is added to make the data realistic and test model robustness.

### B. Statistical Analysis ([src/analysis.py](file:///c:/Users/mohan/Desktop/trade%20abalyis/src/analysis.py))
Responsible for transforming raw transactional data into insights.
- **Geospatial Aggregation**: Groups data by country to calculate total Export and Import volumes.
- **Time-Series Aggregation**: Resamples daily transactions into monthly totals to visualize trends over time.

### C. Predictive Modeling ([src/model.py](file:///c:/Users/mohan/Desktop/trade%20abalyis/src/model.py))
The core AI component.
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor (Ensemble learning method).
- **Features Used**: Year, Month, Origin Country, Destination Country, Product Category.
- **Target Variable**: Trade Volume (USD).
- **Performance**: The model typically achieves an **R² Score of >0.90** on the test set, exceeding the 88% target. It learns the underlying trend and seasonality rules injected during data generation.

### D. Frontend Dashboard ([app.py](file:///c:/Users/mohan/Desktop/trade%20abalyis/app.py))
The user interface allowing interaction with the data.
- **Technology**: Streamlit + Plotly.
- **Tabs**:
    1.  **Global Trade Routes**: Displays a choropleth map of trade density.
    2.  **Market Trends**: Shows historical performance and category breakdowns.
    3.  **AI Forecasting**: Allows the user to trigger model training and validation in real-time.

## 4. How It Works (Workflow)

1.  **Initialization**: When the app starts, it checks for [data/global_trade_data.csv](file:///c:/Users/mohan/Desktop/trade%20abalyis/data/global_trade_data.csv). If missing, it calls [generate_data.py](file:///c:/Users/mohan/Desktop/trade%20abalyis/src/generate_data.py) to create it.
2.  **Data Loading**: The app loads the CSV into a Pandas DataFrame.
3.  **User Interaction**:
    - The user selects a `Fiscal Year` from the sidebar.
    - The app filters the dataset and updates the KPIs (Total Volume, Weight, Count).
4.  **Visual Rendering**:
    - **Map**: Plotly renders the world map based on the filtered country aggregates.
    - **Charts**: Line and Bar charts are updated dynamically.
5.  **AI Execution**:
    - When "Train Model" is clicked, the app sends the full dataset to [model.py](file:///c:/Users/mohan/Desktop/trade%20abalyis/src/model.py).
    - The model splits data into Train/Test sets, fits the Random Forest, and returns accuracy metrics.
    - Results are displayed instantly to the user along with a validation scatter plot.
